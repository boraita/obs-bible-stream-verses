### Adding More Bibles
See the [README.md](https://github.com/boraita/obs-bible-plugin/blob/main/README.md) for instructions on how to add additional Bible translations.

## Troubleshooting

### Control Panel or Overlay Not Loading
- **Check file paths**: Make sure the path to `panel.html` and `browser.html` is correct
- **Use absolute paths**: Don't use relative paths like `./dist/panel.html`
- **Check file permissions**: Ensure OBS has read access to the files

### Bible Not Loading
- Check the browser console in the Control Panel for errors
- Ensure all files from the `dist/` folder are present
- Try refreshing the dock: Right-click the dock title ‚Üí **Refresh**

### Overlay Not Showing Verses
- Ensure both the Control Panel and Browser Source are added
- Check that the Browser Source dimensions are correct
- Verify that the source is not hidden or on a different scene

### Local Server Option
If file:// URLs don't work, you can run a local server:

```bash
cd dist
python -m http.server 8080
```

Then use `http://localhost:8080/panel.html` and `http://localhost:8080/browser.html`
