# Security Policy

## Privacy and Security
This plugin does not collect any user data, nor does it send information to external servers. All bible files (.sqlite) are loaded locally and are never transmitted outside your computer.

## Bible Files Security
- Only uses local `.sqlite` files, never automatically downloaded.
- We recommend obtaining bibles from trusted sources and reviewing them before use.
- Do not include bibles with personal or sensitive data.

## Supported Versions
| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| 2.0.x   | âœ…        |

## Reporting Vulnerabilities
If you find any security issue, please open an issue on GitHub or contact the maintainer.

## Recommendations
- Do not share proprietary bibles without permission.
- If you add new bibles, check that they do not contain malware or hidden data.

## Independence
This project does not depend on any previous fork and all logic has been developed from scratch.
