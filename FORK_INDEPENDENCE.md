# üîì Fork Independence Guide

This guide explains how to completely separate this repository from the original fork.

## Current Status

Your repository currently shows as a fork of `Tosin-JD/obs-bible-plugin`. To make it completely independent:

---

## Option 1: Remove Fork Relationship (Keep History) ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED

This keeps all your commit history but removes GitHub's fork badge.

### Steps:

#### 1. Contact GitHub Support
GitHub doesn't provide a UI to detach forks, so you need to contact them:

1. Go to: https://support.github.com/contact
2. Select: **Account and profile** ‚Üí **Repositories**
3. Subject: `Detach fork: boraita/obs-bible-plugin`
4. Message template:

```
Hello,

I would like to detach my repository from its parent fork:

Repository: boraita/obs-bible-plugin
Original fork: Tosin-JD/obs-bible-plugin

This project has been completely rewritten with:
- New architecture and codebase
- Different features and functionality
- Independent development direction
- Clean Code refactoring
- Version 2.0.0 release

The current code no longer shares functionality with the original fork.
I would like to convert this to a standalone repository.

Thank you!
```

**Response time**: Usually 1-2 business days

#### 2. Remove Upstream Remote (Do This Now)

```bash
# Remove the upstream remote pointing to original fork
git remote remove upstream

# Verify it's removed
git remote -v
# Should only show 'origin' pointing to your repo
```

#### 3. Update Repository Description

After GitHub detaches the fork, update your repo description on GitHub:
- Go to: https://github.com/boraita/obs-bible-plugin
- Click the ‚öôÔ∏è gear icon (Settings) in the About section
- Description: "Display Bible verses in OBS streams with control panel and overlay. 6 Spanish versions included."
- Website: (your website or leave empty)
- Topics: `obs`, `obs-studio`, `bible`, `streaming`, `overlay`, `custom-browser-dock`, `spanish`, `scripture`
- ‚úÖ Remove any fork badges or references

---

## Option 2: Create Fresh Repository (Nuclear Option)

If you want to start completely fresh without any fork history:

### Steps:

#### 1. Create New GitHub Repository
1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Name: `obs-bible-stream-verses` (or keep `obs-bible-plugin`)
3. Description: "Display Bible verses in OBS streams with control panel and overlay"
4. Public
5. **DON'T** initialize with README (you'll push your own)

#### 2. Backup Current Work
```bash
cd /Users/rafael.montano/Workspace/obs-bible-plugin
cd ..
cp -r obs-bible-plugin obs-bible-plugin-backup
```

#### 3. Remove Old Git History & Start Fresh
```bash
cd obs-bible-plugin

# Remove old git history
rm -rf .git

# Initialize new repository
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - OBS Bible Stream Verses v2.0.0

Complete rewrite with:
- Clean Code architecture
- Lazy loading optimization
- 6 Spanish Bible versions
- Comprehensive documentation
- Ready for OBS Forum submission"

# Add new remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with 'boraita' or new name)
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/NEW_REPO_NAME.git

# Push to new repository
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

#### 4. Update All Documentation
Update these files to point to new repository:
- README.md
- INSTALLATION.md
- OBS_FORUM_SUBMISSION.md
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- SUBMISSION_SUMMARY.md
- package.json (repository field)

Replace all instances of:
- `github.com/boraita/obs-bible-plugin` ‚Üí new URL

---

## Option 3: Squash All Commits into One

Keep the same repository but consolidate all history into a single commit:

```bash
# Create orphan branch (no history)
git checkout --orphan new-main

# Stage all files
git add .

# Create single commit
git commit -m "OBS Bible Stream Verses v2.0.0

Complete plugin for displaying Bible verses in OBS Studio.

Features:
- Control Panel (Custom Browser Dock)
- Overlay (Browser Source)
- 6 Spanish Bible versions
- Search by reference or text
- Lazy loading optimization
- Clean Code architecture

Initial release after complete rewrite."

# Delete old main branch
git branch -D main

# Rename new branch to main
git branch -m main

# Force push (WARNING: This rewrites history)
git push -f origin main
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING**: This will rewrite history. Only do this if you're sure no one else has cloned your repo.

## Recommended Approach

**For your situation, I recommend Option 1:**

1. ‚úÖ Remove upstream remote NOW (safe, reversible)
2. ‚úÖ Contact GitHub Support to detach fork (keeps history)
3. ‚úÖ Update repository metadata after detachment

This gives you:
- ‚úÖ Independent repository status
- ‚úÖ Keeps your commit history
- ‚úÖ No fork badge on GitHub
- ‚úÖ Clean slate for OBS Forum submission

## After Independence

Once independent, update these references:

### In README.md
Add a note about independence:
```markdown
## History

This project was originally forked from [Tosin-JD/obs-bible-plugin](https://github.com/Tosin-JD/obs-bible-plugin) 
but has been completely rewritten with a new architecture, features, and codebase. 
Version 2.0.0 represents a fresh start with no shared code from the original fork.
```

### In package.json
Ensure repository field points to your repo:
```json
{
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/boraita/obs-bible-plugin.git"
  }
}
```

## Verification Checklist

After independence:
- [ ] GitHub no longer shows "forked from" badge
- [ ] `git remote -v` only shows your origin
- [ ] Repository description updated
- [ ] Topics/tags added
- [ ] README mentions independence
- [ ] All documentation links point to your repo
