## Message Template

```
Hello GitHub Support Team,

I would like to request that my repository be detached from its parent fork and converted to a standalone repository.

Repository Details:
- My Repository: https://github.com/boraita/obs-bible-plugin
- Original Fork: https://github.com/Tosin-JD/obs-bible-plugin

Reason for Request:

This project has undergone a complete rewrite for version 2.0.0 and no longer shares code or functionality with the original fork. The changes include:

1. Complete architectural rewrite using Clean Code principles
2. New features and functionality not present in the original
3. Performance optimization with lazy loading (95% bundle size reduction)
4. Comprehensive documentation suite
5. Independent development roadmap
6. Different target audience and use cases

Version 2.0.0 represents a fresh start with:
- New codebase structure
- Different build system optimization
- Centralized configuration approach
- No shared code with the original fork
- Ready for independent release and distribution

The project is now ready for public release on OBS Forum and GitHub as an independent tool, and the fork relationship no longer accurately represents the project's status.

I have already removed the upstream remote locally and updated all documentation to reflect the project's independence.

Could you please detach this repository from the fork relationship so it appears as a standalone repository?

Thank you for your assistance!

Best regards,
Rafael Montaño
```

## What Happens After Submission

1. **Response Time**: Usually 1-2 business days (sometimes faster)
2. **GitHub Action**: They will detach your repository from the fork network
3. **Result**: 
   - Your repository will no longer show "forked from Tosin-JD/obs-bible-plugin"
   - It will appear as a standalone repository
   - All your commits and history remain intact
   - You'll still be the owner with full control

---

## After GitHub Responds

Once GitHub confirms the fork has been detached:

### 1. Verify on GitHub
- Go to: https://github.com/boraita/obs-bible-plugin
- The "forked from" badge should be gone
- Repository should appear as standalone

### 2. Update Repository Metadata
1. Click the ⚙️ gear icon in the "About" section
2. Add description: 
   ```
   Display Bible verses in OBS streams with control panel and overlay. 6 Spanish Bible versions included.
   ```
3. Add website (optional): Your personal site or leave empty
4. Add topics/tags:
   - obs
   - obs-studio
   - bible
   - streaming
   - overlay
   - custom-browser-dock
   - spanish
   - scripture
   - verses

### 3. Create v2.0.0 Release
Now you can create your first official release as an independent project:
```bash
pnpm release
```

Then create GitHub Release with the generated ZIP file.

## Alternative: If You Want to Wait

If you prefer not to contact GitHub Support right now, you can:

1. ✅ Keep the current setup (upstream already removed)
2. ✅ Proceed with OBS Forum submission anyway
3. ✅ Mention in your README that it's independent
4. ⏸️ Contact GitHub Support later when ready

The fork badge doesn't prevent you from:
- Creating releases
- Submitting to OBS Forum
- Being listed as an independent tool
- Accepting contributions

---

## Status Checklist

- [x] Upstream remote removed (`git remote remove upstream`)
- [x] README.md updated with project history section
- [x] package.json updated with repository fields
- [ ] GitHub Support contacted for fork detachment
- [ ] GitHub confirms detachment (wait for response)
- [ ] Repository metadata updated on GitHub
- [ ] First independent release created (v2.0.0)

---

## Notes

- The upstream remote removal is permanent (unless you manually re-add it)
- You can proceed with all development and releases now
- The fork detachment is cosmetic on GitHub's UI
- Your commit history and work remain unchanged
- This doesn't affect functionality, only GitHub's display

**Next Step**: Copy the message template above and submit it to GitHub Support when you're ready!
